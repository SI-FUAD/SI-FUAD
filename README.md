## 🎓 Academic Background

- **O Levels (2018)** – *Manarat Dhaka International College (MDIC)*  
- **A Levels (2020)** – *Manarat Dhaka International College (MDIC)*  
- **B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (2020–2024)** – *Brac University*  

During my undergraduate journey, I built a strong foundation in programming, web development, and electronics. I worked on several team-based and solo projects using technologies such as Python, Flask, Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. I also gained hands-on experience with microcontrollers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), sensors, ICs, digital circuits, and networking tools like Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 🧠 Thesis: Sentiment Analysis in Bengali

My undergraduate thesis focused on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and sentiment analysis. We collected and processed 48,000 product reviews from the e-commerce platform **Daraz**, written in Bengali, English, and Romanized Bangla. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, we created a Bengali-only dataset and applied multiple machine learning and deep learning models:

- **Machine Learning**: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM  
- **Deep Learning**: BiLSTM, Multilingual BERT, BanglaBERT

The goal was to help sellers identify popular products by analyzing user sentiment within the Bengali language ecosystem.

## 📚 Technologies Explored Through Online Learning

After completing my degree, I further expanded my knowledge through YouTube tutorials and project-based playlists from popular creators such as **Hablu Programmer**, **Procoder BD**, **Learn with Sumit**, **Rabbil Hasan**, and others.

Through this self-guided learning, I explored:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS  
- **Frameworks**: React, Vue.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PHP, Laravel, .NET  
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB (Mongoose)  
- **CMS & Tools**: WordPress, Elementor, WooCommerce  
- **Others**: REST API, JWT, Fetch API, JSON, Git, GitHub, GitHub Desktop, Inertia.js, Eloquent ORM

Although I haven’t built complete projects using all of these technologies yet, this learning journey has given me practical insight into how they work. It means I can understand, contribute to, or extend projects involving them more confidently. Combined with AI-assisted workflows and continued practice, I’m well-equipped to build full-stack applications effectively when needed.

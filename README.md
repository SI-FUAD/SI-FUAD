## 🧠 Thesis Work (Sentiment Analysis in Bengali)

My undergraduate thesis focused on **sentiment analysis using NLP techniques**. We collected and cleaned 48,000 e-commerce reviews (in Bengali, English, and Romanized Bangla) from **Daraz**. We introduced a **new Bengali review dataset**, applied preprocessing, and trained several models including:
- ML: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM
- DL: BiLSTM, Multilingual BERT, BanglaBERT

Our goal was to help sellers identify quality products through user sentiment analysis in the Bengali language space.

## 🎓 Academic Background

- **O Levels (2018)** – *Manarat Dhaka International College (MDIC)*  
- **A Levels (2020)** – *Manarat Dhaka International College (MDIC)*  
- **B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering (2020–2024)** – *Brac University*  

During my undergraduate journey, I built a strong foundation in programming, web development, and electronics. I worked on several team-based and solo projects using technologies such as Python, Flask, Django, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. I also gained hands-on experience with microcontrollers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), sensors, ICs, digital circuits, and networking tools like Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 🧠 Thesis: Sentiment Analysis in Bengali

My undergraduate thesis focused on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and sentiment analysis. We collected and processed 48,000 product reviews from the e-commerce platform **Daraz**, written in Bengali, English, and Romanized Bangla. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, we created a Bengali-only dataset and applied multiple machine learning and deep learning models:

- **Machine Learning**: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM  
- **Deep Learning**: BiLSTM, Multilingual BERT, BanglaBERT

The goal was to help sellers identify popular products by analyzing user sentiment within the Bengali language ecosystem.

## 📚 Technologies Explored Through Online Learning

After completing my degree, I continued learning modern web technologies by following YouTube playlists and hands-on tutorials from popular creators like **Hablu Programmer**, **Procoder BD**, **Learn with Sumit**, **Rabbil Hasan**, and others.

Through this self-driven exploration, I covered:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS  
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, React Native, Angular.js, Vue.js, Next.js, Flask, Django  
- **Languages**: TypeScript.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PHP, Laravel, .NET  
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB (Mongoose)  
- **CMS & Tools**: WordPress, Elementor, WooCommerce  
- **APIs & Utilities**: REST API, JWT, Fetch API, AJAX, Axios, JSON, Postman  
- **Others**: Git, GitHub, GitHub Desktop, Inertia.js, Eloquent ORM

While I haven’t yet built complete projects with these technologies (except for basic ones using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), the purpose of this learning journey was to familiarize myself with modern web development stacks and concepts. No projects were developed during this phase—my goal was to build foundational awareness and confidence. With this exposure and the support of AI tools, I now feel well-prepared to build and contribute to complete full-stack applications efficiently when required.

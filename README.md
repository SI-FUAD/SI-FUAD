## 🧠 Thesis: Sentiment Analysis in Bengali

My undergraduate thesis focused on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and sentiment analysis. We collected and processed 48,000 product reviews from the e-commerce platform **Daraz**, written in Bengali, English, and Romanized Bangla. After cleaning the data, we created a Bengali-only dataset and applied several machine learning and deep learning models:

- **Machine Learning**: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM  
- **Deep Learning**: BiLSTM, Multilingual BERT, BanglaBERT

The aim was to help sellers identify popular products based on user sentiment in the Bengali language space.
